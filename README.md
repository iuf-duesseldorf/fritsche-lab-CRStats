# CRStats - Concentration-Response Statistics

### Package Ecosystem

**CRStats** builds upon the following packages not developed by members of the **CRStats** team:

- R6: Reference class objects.
- data.table: Extension of R's data.frame.
- drc: Analysis of Dose-Response Curves
- ggplot2: Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics
- ggprism: A 'ggplot2' Extension Inspired by 'GraphPad Prism'

All these packages are well curated and mature; we expect no problems with dependencies.
Additionally, we suggest the following packages for extra functionality:

- For parallelization: future / future.apply.
- For progress bars: progressr.
- For capturing output, warnings, and exceptions: evaluate or callr.
